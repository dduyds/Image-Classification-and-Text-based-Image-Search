# Image Classification and Text based Image Search
## Overview
This project is an interactive application that leverages a custom CLIP (Contrastive Languageâ€“Image Pretraining) model to classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset and retrieve similar images based on text descriptions. The model is built and customized using PyTorch to work effectively on the CIFAR-10 dataset.

## Key Features
- Custom CLIP model architecture tailored for CIFAR-10 dataset classification and retrieval.
- Image classification and text-based image retrieval by computing and comparing embeddings.
- Clean and user-friendly interface designed with Streamlit for easy and seamless interaction.

## Demo
A demo of the application allows users to upload or select an image from CIFAR-10, classify it, and perform text-based image search to find visually similar images based on textual input.
